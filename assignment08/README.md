# Selene - Simple Meditation for Complex Lives
## Fontanna Yee - DH 150
### Introduction
My project is a meditation app called Selene, named after the moon goddess for a sense of calming, that incorporates a minimalist design for simplicity of use, especially for middle and older-aged users. 

### Clear design statement
My project hopes to assist primarily middle-aged women in finding a meditation practice that best addresses their physical and mental health concerns. In addition to daily life stressors such as working, running a household, and raising children, the current Covid-19 pandemic has created another external stressor that this target population has to face and overcome. With this in mind, and based on previous weeks of user research, I have identified three key features that minimize excess stress in a meditation routine. 

**Task 1: Changing the Language**

One of my personas is a middle-aged woman who doesn’t speak English as a native language, so I included a language button at the bottom left of each screen. When 
the user presses the button, three different language options appear. Once a language is selected, the user is redirected to the home screen. 

**Task 2: Turning off Notifications**

My second persona is a middle-aged woman who has a hectic family life and receives frequent calls from her daughter when she is taking care of her grandchildren. Because of this need, I included a notification feature at the bottom left of the screen as well. When the user presses the feature, they can choose to mute their notifications for a certain amount of time. Once a choice is selected, the user receives a confirmation. 

**Task 3: Customizing Meditation Options**

Both my personas are looking for simple designs with easy-to-recognize features, which is why I placed the customization panel on the home screen, which is easy to recognize and read. The customization panel is organized into different categories that have more specific options when the user clicks on it.

### Competitor analysis

The first step of my project was to evaluate competitor sites to see what worked and what didn't. The two platforms I compared was a website called Mindful.org and a meditation app called Calm.

### User research
After reviewing competitor apps, I conducted user research to gain a fresh perspective on what other users would like to see in a meditation app.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
After my contextual interview, I created user personas of the ideal users of my application to see if my application would best match their needs.

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test how to integrate these features into a functioning and intuitive layout and ensure that they can be used to achieve the goals intended.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
After many weeks of ideation, research, and usability testing, my high fidelity prototype solidifies many of the findings and adjustments I have made over the past few weeks into as close of a simulation of the real product as possible. By creating a high fidelity prototype, users can easily test the UX/UI functions of my meditation app and receive feedback for each action, and their testing will allow me to understand what processes are working well and what processes need additional adjustments.

### Optional evaluation and revision history 
The prototyping process was complex but ultimately extremely rewarding, as I learned a lot about the design and revision process, and how designing with the user in mind requires a lot of feedback from impression tests and cognitive walkthroughs. It surprised me how often features that intuitively made a lot of sense to me were confusing and ambiguous for the tester, but it was insightful in helping me adapt my design to best fit the user’s needs. It was also rewarding to learn how to use Figma in designing my prototype. I did not anticipate creating as many screens as I ended up creating, but I realized that some functions that I thought were simple, such as checkboxes, actually had dozens of combinations that I had to design individually. Throughout the whole process I was glad that I got the opportunity to learn design skills and gain feedback from users. 

Based on feedback from prototyping testing, I changed a few features, such as getting rid of the unnecessary and confusing menu bar, and adding in options for people who do not want to customize their meditation. As the designer, I didn’t realize that these features may or may not be necessary, and it was good to get feedback from users. I also changed some icons to be bigger and more visible. One suggestion that I believe requires further testing is whether the wording of the “cancel” button should be changed to “back,” as one user was confused, but the other testers understood the use of the button. Over time, with more users and more testing, I know that I will gain further insight into adjustments needed for my app prototype.
