# Selene - Simple Meditation for Complex Lives
## Fontanna Yee - DH 150
### Introduction
My project is a meditation app called Selene, named after the moon goddess for a sense of calming, that incorporates a minimalist design for simplicity of use, especially for middle and older-aged users. 

### Clear design statement
My project hopes to assist primarily middle-aged women in finding a meditation practice that best addresses their physical and mental health concerns. In addition to daily life stressors such as working, running a household, and raising children, the current Covid-19 pandemic has created another external stressor that this target population has to face and overcome. With this in mind, and based on previous weeks of user research, I have identified three key features that minimize excess stress in a meditation routine. 

**Task 1: Changing the Language**

One of my personas is a middle-aged woman who doesn’t speak English as a native language, so I included a language button at the bottom left of each screen. When 
the user presses the button, three different language options appear. Once a language is selected, the user is redirected to the home screen. 

**Task 2: Turning off Notifications**

My second persona is a middle-aged woman who has a hectic family life and receives frequent calls from her daughter when she is taking care of her grandchildren. Because of this need, I included a notification feature at the bottom left of the screen as well. When the user presses the feature, they can choose to mute their notifications for a certain amount of time. Once a choice is selected, the user receives a confirmation. 

**Task 3: Customizing Meditation Options**

Both my personas are looking for simple designs with easy-to-recognize features, which is why I placed the customization panel on the home screen, which is easy to recognize and read. The customization panel is organized into different categories that have more specific options when the user clicks on it.

**Competitor analysis**

The first step of my project was to evaluate competitor sites to see what worked and what didn't. The two platforms I compared was a website called Mindful.org and a meditation app called Calm. [read more...](https://github.com/fyee1215/DH150-FontannaYee/blob/main/README.md)
