# DH150 Assignment06 Low Fidelity Prototype - Fontanna Yee
## Project Description

My project hopes to assist primarily middle-aged women in finding a meditation practice that best addresses their physical and mental health concerns. In addition to daily life stressors such as working, running a household, and raising children, the current Covid-19 pandemic has created another external stressor that this target population has to face and overcome. With this in mind, and based on previous weeks of user research, I have identified three key features that minimize excess stress in a meditation routine. 

1) Language - Allow user to change to a language that is more comfortable for them to communicate
2) Do Not Disturb - Silence notifications while using the app to meditate to minimize distractions 
3) Customization - Allow user to customize their preferences for meditation by age, length of practice, stressor, and other miscellaneous items

My two user personas were created to address concerns of language barriers, household distractions, and unfamiliarity in using technology. From that analysis, I realized that it was essential that my project allow users to switch to a different language setting if they do not speak English natively, provide the option to silence notifications to create a more immersive meditation experience, and be minimalistic and simple to use for users unfamiliar with technology. 

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test how to integrate these features into a functioning and intuitive layout and ensure that they can be used to achieve the goals intended.
