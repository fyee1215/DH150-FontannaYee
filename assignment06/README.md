# DH150 Assignment06 Low Fidelity Prototype - Fontanna Yee
## Project Description

My project hopes to assist primarily middle-aged women in finding a meditation practice that best addresses their physical and mental health concerns. In addition to daily life stressors such as working, running a household, and raising children, the current Covid-19 pandemic has created another external stressor that this target population has to face and overcome. With this in mind, and based on previous weeks of user research, I have identified three key features that minimize excess stress in a meditation routine. 

1) Language - Allow user to change to a language that is more comfortable for them to communicate
2) Do Not Disturb - Silence notifications while using the app to meditate to minimize distractions 
3) Customization - Allow user to customize their preferences for meditation by age, length of practice, stressor, and other miscellaneous items

My two user personas were created to address concerns of language barriers, household distractions, and unfamiliarity in using technology. From that analysis, I realized that it was essential that my project allow users to switch to a different language setting if they do not speak English natively, provide the option to silence notifications to create a more immersive meditation experience, and be minimalistic and simple to use for users unfamiliar with technology. 

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test how to integrate these features into a functioning and intuitive layout and ensure that they can be used to achieve the goals intended.

### Notes on Wireflow Testing

**Feature 1: Language**
	
The participant seemed to find the language button located on the homepage intuitive, as she immediately used that icon to navigate to the language page. However, in this feature and consistently through testing, she seemed to neglect the okay button after selecting her choice that I included as a confirmation step before opening the next page. She successfully completed this task by ending at the home page, now in Chinese. 

**Feature 2: Do Not Disturb**

The participant also seemed to find the bell button located on the homepage intuitive, as she also navigated here immediately when finding the Do Not Disturb function. The rest of this process went smoothly. She successfully completed this task by closing the confirmation page that notifications would be turned off for an hour, and navigating back to the home page. 

**Feature 3: Customization**

The participantâ€™s reaction to this task was interesting to me. I believed that three bars at the top right corner of a screen was a common feature across all app platforms to symbolize a drop down menu, but the participant struggled for a moment to find the customization menu. She noted that it would be more useful to place the customization feature in a more prominent location, especially considering it was a hallmark feature of the app. I also believe that the search bar in the center of the home screen added to confusion because it was unclear whether she should search there or through the menu. The participant successfully completed the task by finding meditation practices for four different kinds of customization.
