## Pilot Usability Test
### Introduction: Mindful.org
Recently, there has been an increasing need for accessible online mental health services, especially as the Covid-19 pandemic has led to job insecurity, social isolation, and other stressors that left untreated could lead to severe mental health concerns. Keeping this in mind, I decided to evaluate a website called Mindful.org, which specializes in mindful meditation practices and meditation education for all age groups and health concerns. In my initial scan of the website’s usability, I found it to be very cluttered and confusing to navigate, filled with inconsistent headlines and irrelevant information. After conducting a heuristic evaluation, I found the following three issues to be most problematic in usability. 

**1. Match between system and the real world**

This website does not consolidate related information about the same topic on the same webpage but instead disperses the information in pieces throughout the website. Information is categorized according to both mental health concern and age, which makes any search question hard to answer. 

**2. Aesthetic and minimalist design**

This website presents too much information on a single page in a cluttered, disorganized format. Each page has unnecessary competing colors that split the focus of the user, and important information is often buried by interrupting subscription notices and sign ups. 

**3. Help and documentation**

The help features of this website are presented infrequently and in obscure locations, and often on non-important pages. The only place where a help feature is located is at the bottom the “Directory” page, which is a strange place to look for help, and the user would have to leave the website to contact help services. 

### Purpose of Usability Test
By conducting this pilot usability test, I hope to confirm that the three problems I identified in my heuristic evaluation are universal to most users, and also identify other errors that I did not notice in my initial evaluation. To test these issues, I asked my user to perform three tasks: 

1. search "stress" for a breathing exercise
2. find a mediation practice for children
3. find the email address to contact for help

Based on the findings of these usability tests, I hope to improve the website but consolidating information into more logical categories, simplifying the website design, and placing the help functions in a more prominent place. 

### Methodology
The pilot usability test was conducted in my apartment in Westwood, Los Angeles (the portable minimalistic lab). I communicated with my participant through Zoom throughout the entire usability testing process, and I recorded the informed consent, background questions, pretest, tasks, and post-test questionnaire process. During the three tasks, I asked the participant to think aloud their search process, and I recorded their approach and reactions appropriately. While participating in the usability test, the participant also filled out a survey to record their answers.

### Reflection
I learned a lot about being both a participant and a moderator after conducting the pilot test. The most important takeaway was that there were multiple paths to reach the same answer. In all my tasks, I had envisioned the participant starting from a certain point and passing through several checkpoints before finding the answers they were looking for. However, I had not taken into account the flexibility of the website, which allowed participants to find answers in multiple different ways. Oftentimes, tasks that I had envisioned as more difficult were actually quite easy for participants because of this function. Ultimately, I learned that participants could be very adaptive and learn to search for answers outside-of-the-box, which I did not expect as a moderator. The next time I conduct a usability test, I will firstly make my questions much more specific in terms of the answers I am looking for. This time, some of my wording was vague, which caused the participant some confusion. In addition, I hope to learn how to be more patient and express myself more neutrally. There were a lot of times where the participant missed the information I wanted them to see, or selected information that was related but not the same, and I wanted to correct them or nudge them in the right direction, while knowing that it was not my place to do so. However, I learned a lot from this first session, and I would like to continue developing my moderator skills in the future.
