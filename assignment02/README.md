## Pilot Usability Test
### Introduction: Mindful.org
Recently, there has been an increasing need for accessible online mental health services, especially as the Covid-19 pandemic has led to job insecurity, social isolation, and other stressors that left untreated could lead to severe mental health concerns. Keeping this in mind, I decided to evaluate a website called Mindful.org, which specializes in mindful meditation practices and meditation education for all age groups and health concerns. In my initial scan of the website’s usability, I found it to be very cluttered and confusing to navigate, filled with inconsistent headlines and irrelevant information. After conducting a heuristic evaluation, I found the following three issues to be most problematic in usability. 

**1. Match between system and the real world**
* This website does not consolidate related information about the same topic on the same webpage but instead disperses the information in pieces throughout the website. Information is categorized according to both mental health concern and age, which makes any search question hard to answer. 

**2. Aesthetic and minimalist design**
* This website presents too much information on a single page in a cluttered, disorganized format. Each page has unnecessary competing colors that split the focus of the user, and important information is often buried by interrupting subscription notices and sign ups. 

**3. Help and documentation**
* The help features of this website are presented infrequently and in obscure locations, and often on non-important pages. The only place where a help feature is located is at the bottom the “Directory” page, which is a strange place to look for help, and the user would have to leave the website to contact help services.
