### Main Design Challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?**

The purpose of this project is to help ease the process of finding a meditation practice that best suits the user’s needs, especially based on their age and their primary health concern. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**

This activity will help fulfill the user’s belonging and esteem needs. A multitude of mental health concerns arise because of a lack of strong personal connections and a social support network, which has been exacerbated due to the isolation and loneliness that Covid-19 has caused. In addition, mental health also worsens when people have low self-esteem and face personal challenges, such as losing job security and other essentials during this time. The intention of this activity is to promote meditation as a solution for addressing isolation and self-esteem worries. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

One of the most traditional solutions is going to meditation classes in a physical studio, where someone skilled in mediation can lead routines that people can follow. However, due to the current pandemic, this is an unsafe practice that people should stay away from. 

There are also a variety of apps and websites that allow users to choose from hundreds of calming sounds and meditation practices, where a digital voice can walk them through the steps they need to take to meditate successfully. Many of these sounds can also be found on Youtube for free by simply typing in “meditation practice” into the search bar. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

The biggest limitation that can be improved with digital technology is eliminating the time it takes to drive back and forth from a studio, as meditation can now be done in the comfort of the user’s home. Opponents to meditation often cite not having enough time to meditate as the reason for not doing it, and using a digital medium shortens the time commitment, allows the user to block out a specific time of day for meditation, and can send them reminders so they don’t forget to follow through. 

Another improvement is decreasing the sentiment that meditation does not work. Studios can treat meditation with a one-size-fits-all approach, and a digital platform can allow the user to personalize their routine so it best fits their needs and pace.
