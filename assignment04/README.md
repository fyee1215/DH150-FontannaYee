### Main Design Challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?**

The purpose of this project is to help ease the process of finding a meditation practice that best suits the user’s needs, especially based on their age and their primary health concern. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**

This activity will help fulfill the user’s belonging and esteem needs. A multitude of mental health concerns arise because of a lack of strong personal connections and a social support network, which has been exacerbated due to the isolation and loneliness that Covid-19 has caused. In addition, mental health also worsens when people have low self-esteem and face personal challenges, such as losing job security and other essentials during this time. The intention of this activity is to promote meditation as a solution for addressing isolation and self-esteem worries. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

One of the most traditional solutions is going to meditation classes in a physical studio, where someone skilled in mediation can lead routines that people can follow. However, due to the current pandemic, this is an unsafe practice that people should stay away from. 

There are also a variety of apps and websites that allow users to choose from hundreds of calming sounds and meditation practices, where a digital voice can walk them through the steps they need to take to meditate successfully. Many of these sounds can also be found on Youtube for free by simply typing in “meditation practice” into the search bar. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

The biggest limitation that can be improved with digital technology is eliminating the time it takes to drive back and forth from a studio, as meditation can now be done in the comfort of the user’s home. Opponents to meditation often cite not having enough time to meditate as the reason for not doing it, and using a digital medium shortens the time commitment, allows the user to block out a specific time of day for meditation, and can send them reminders so they don’t forget to follow through. 

Another improvement is decreasing the sentiment that meditation does not work. Studios can treat meditation with a one-size-fits-all approach, and a digital platform can allow the user to personalize their routine so it best fits their needs and pace. 

### Target Users

**What are the characteristics of users?** 

Demographics: ideally middle-aged women, and also all older adults, students, and young children
Preference: users that want to address a certain mental health concern or want to start a meditation routine for positive benefits
Expertise: no expertise is required, and this activity actually encourages beginners to use it

**Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**

In the traditional method, users would go to a studio to practice meditation with others. However, in the digital method, users can practice meditation anywhere, as long as they have a digital device and quiet place they can concentrate, either at home, at a park, or anywhere they choose. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**

The goal is to successfully find and complete a meditation practice. To accomplish this, they can search for practices online, or download a meditation app, where they can choose whatever practice they want to do. If a user chooses to attend a physical class, they can choose a class at a location close to them and attend at specified times of the week. 

### Research Methods

For this project, I used a combination of two methods: interview and participatory observation. I first asked the participant a series of background questions to gauge their familiarity with the activity. I then asked the participant to search for a meditation practice in two ways: first by finding one online, and second by choosing one off a popular existing mediation app, Calm. Finally, I asked the participant follow-up questions some aspects not included in the main tasks. 

Both methods were completed in the user’s own home, where they felt comfortable and would most likely complete the activity in daily life. I used Zoom to record the interview and user tasks and also the transcript for the session.
