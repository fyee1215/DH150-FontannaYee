## Main Design Challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?**

The purpose of this project is to help ease the process of finding a meditation practice that best suits the user’s needs, especially based on their age and their primary health concern. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**

This activity will help fulfill the user’s belonging and esteem needs. A multitude of mental health concerns arise because of a lack of strong personal connections and a social support network, which has been exacerbated due to the isolation and loneliness that Covid-19 has caused. In addition, mental health also worsens when people have low self-esteem and face personal challenges, such as losing job security and other essentials during this time. The intention of this activity is to promote meditation as a solution for addressing isolation and self-esteem worries. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

One of the most traditional solutions is going to meditation classes in a physical studio, where someone skilled in mediation can lead routines that people can follow. However, due to the current pandemic, this is an unsafe practice that people should stay away from. 

There are also a variety of apps and websites that allow users to choose from hundreds of calming sounds and meditation practices, where a digital voice can walk them through the steps they need to take to meditate successfully. Many of these sounds can also be found on Youtube for free by simply typing in “meditation practice” into the search bar. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

The biggest limitation that can be improved with digital technology is eliminating the time it takes to drive back and forth from a studio, as meditation can now be done in the comfort of the user’s home. Opponents to meditation often cite not having enough time to meditate as the reason for not doing it, and using a digital medium shortens the time commitment, allows the user to block out a specific time of day for meditation, and can send them reminders so they don’t forget to follow through. 

Another improvement is decreasing the sentiment that meditation does not work. Studios can treat meditation with a one-size-fits-all approach, and a digital platform can allow the user to personalize their routine so it best fits their needs and pace. 

## Target Users

**What are the characteristics of users?** 

Demographics: ideally middle-aged women, and also all older adults, students, and young children

Preference: users that want to address a certain mental health concern or want to start a meditation routine for positive benefits

Expertise: no expertise is required, and this activity actually encourages beginners to use it

**Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**

In the traditional method, users would go to a studio to practice meditation with others. However, in the digital method, users can practice meditation anywhere, as long as they have a digital device and quiet place they can concentrate, either at home, at a park, or anywhere they choose. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**

The goal is to successfully find and complete a meditation practice. To accomplish this, they can search for practices online, or download a meditation app, where they can choose whatever practice they want to do. If a user chooses to attend a physical class, they can choose a class at a location close to them and attend at specified times of the week. 

## Research Methods

For this project, I used a combination of two methods: interview and participatory observation. I first asked the participant a series of background questions to gauge their familiarity with the activity. I then asked the participant to search for a meditation practice in two ways: first by finding one online, and second by choosing one off a popular existing mediation app, Calm. Finally, I asked the participant follow-up questions some aspects not included in the main tasks. 

Both methods were completed in the user’s own home, where they felt comfortable and would most likely complete the activity in daily life. I used Zoom to record the interview and user tasks and also the transcript for the session.

### Interesting User Insights

**The importance of nature in meditation**

  * *“And it's nice, because like, it has, there's trees like outside on the hill, and stuff like that. So I think I like being closer to nature, and it's quiet. And I like  knowing that nobody else is awake.”*

**The cost of meditation apps**

  * *“Because I think at a certain point, it would be more economic just to learn how to meditate and just do it yourself by discipline, versus paying a ton.”*

**Faces and titles of exercises are important**

  * *“I feel like because meditation is such a personal thing. I don't really feel inclined to click on one with a face on it. Because like, Oh, that's somebody else. That's not me. Even though like usually we think faces are more attractive, like when we're trying to draw people's attention. … So I think the pictures and the way the titles are named, really, is what I consider."*
  
**The importance of simplicity and authenticity**

  * *“Think simplicity is a big one for me. Like, especially if I'm trying to go somewhere, even virtually to clear my mind. I wouldn't want a cluttered app or a very cheesy app. Like I just hate cheesiness all around. … I just like maybe a simple, like home page, something that I can just go to for my daily routine, something I can use to track my progress. Like, I don't think I need a ton of stuff in terms of like, music or, like, very pretty aesthetic things.”*

**The importance of customized options**

  * *“I think having somebody to help me assess what I need, would be helpful. Like the questions that come asked at first, like, what are you doing this for? What do you hope to get out of it that was useful, not just for their algorithms, but also for me to kind of streamline my thoughts?”*

**A con of using a digital platform**
  * *“But also like, because meditation is inherently supposed to be like distraction free, right? And the phone is a huge distractor. So maybe finding a way to, I don't know, like, make the user less reliant on looking at the screen while they're doing the meditation would be helpful.”*
  
## Reflection

Perhaps because I was more used to conducting interviews, but I felt that this user interview flowed much better than the usability test a few weeks ago. I think this session was much smoother because I wasn’t leading the participant through a strict series of tasks that I envisioned being completed in a singular way. This time, the user had much more flexibility to do things in their own way and was much freer to contribute their own thoughts and opinions. As a moderator, I didn’t feel pressured to tell the participant what to do or prompt them to answer in a certain way, and I felt a lot more comfortable and natural. It was really interesting to see what insights the participant brought to the table. They suggested many ideas that I hadn’t even thought of, such as the monetization of meditation concept and how faces and titles of meditation exercises can draw in a user or push them away. Through this exercise, I definitely see the value of conducting user research, and I know now that the designer has a limited perspective. I’m excited to try conducting user research again, and I hope to improve my moderator skills the next time.
