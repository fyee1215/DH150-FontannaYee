# DH150 Assignment07 High Fidelity Prototype
## Project Description
### Summary
My project is a meditation app called Selene, named after the moon goddess for a sense of calming, that incorporates a minimalist design for simplicity of use, especially for middle and older-aged users. 
### Process and Purpose
After many weeks of ideation, research, and usability testing, my high fidelity prototype solidifies many of the findings and adjustments I have made over the past few weeks into as close of a simulation of the real product as possible. By creating a high fidelity prototype, users can easily test the UX/UI functions of my meditation app and receive feedback for each action, and their testing will allow me to understand what processes are working well and what processes need additional adjustments. 
### Tasks
The two user personas I created shaped the tasks that I created wireflows for in my high fidelity prototype. 

**Task 1: Changing the Language**

One of my personas is a middle-aged woman who doesn’t speak English as a native language, so I included a language button at the bottom left of each screen. When the user presses the button, three different language options appear. Once a language is selected, the user is redirected to the home screen. 

**Task 2: Turning off Notifications**

My second persona is a middle-aged woman who has a hectic family life and receives frequent calls from her daughter when she is taking care of her grandchildren. Because of this need, I included a notification feature at the bottom left of the screen as well. When the user presses the feature, they can choose to mute their notifications for a certain amount of time. Once a choice is selected, the user receives a confirmation. 

**Task 3: Customizing Meditation Options**

Both my personas are looking for simple designs with easy-to-recognize features, which is why I placed the customization panel on the home screen, which is easy to recognize and read. The customization panel is organized into different categories that have more specific options when the user clicks on it.

## Graphic Design

### Reasoning for Design
Because I was designing an application targeted towards older adults who might be unfamiliar with technology, I kept the color scheme and the design as minimalist as possible. I went for a purple color scheme because I felt that the colors were easy to see without straining the eyes, and purple complemented the name of my meditation app, Selene, which references nighttime and the moon. I also kept the design minimalistic and centered around mostly text so that users would not get confused with a cluttered and busy homepage and additional screens. I used a sans serif font in a large text size so that the words would be clear and easy to read, and I kept the words dark purple and white to maintain a high contrast with the background. Thinking especially about my personas and about the design principles I learned, I made sure to add written labels for my icons, such as “Language” and “Notifications,” because I know that the icons are not intuitive to understand for everyone.

### Summary of Findings
1) The user really enjoyed the simplicity of the color scheme and felt that it gave the app a clean feel. 
2) The user also appreciated the clarity of the customization panel on the home page. During low fidelity prototype testing, this user mentioned that considering that customization was a key feature of the app, it should be placed in a more prominent place than hidden in the menu bar. They felt that the new design made this feature more accessible. 
3) The user suggested that I round my boxes and the boxes of the meditation practices, which was interesting to me because I had never thought about that before. They said that since most of my design was rounded, it would be cohesive to continue the round theme. In addition, they mentioned that round edges are more calming and suitable for an app that seeks to help people find peace. 
4) The user really likes the simplicity of the fonts, and especially likes the font for the app, although they are not sure whether that font is readable for everyone. 

## Accessibility Testing
Accessibility Reports found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sDmghNsibMcokayd4rOwCI0XKE_d94X9?usp=sharing)

Accessibility Testing showed that my color scheme was compliant with WCAG2.0 AA level requirements. The dark purple against white passed all AA and AAA requirements. The light purple against white exceeded the 3:1 ratio needed for large text but not the 4.5:1 ratio for small text, but since I only used white font for large text in the name of the app and the home page, it is acceptable. The dark purple against light purple exceeded the 3:1 ratio as well, and because this contrast is used for decorative and stylistic components and not text, according to the WCAG2.0 AA guidelines, it is acceptable.
